# Abstract

Apple announced their 2 year transition plan to internally-designed Apple
Silicon processors, ending the use of Intel x86-64 processors, at the
World Wide Developers Conference 2020 [@apple-announcement]. This report will
explore the transition's motives and results through investigating
the history and characteristics of other contemporary processor families,
comparing them to Apple's M1 series. Information was sourced through academic
reports, press releases, news articles, and the processor designer's
documentation.
