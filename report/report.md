# Abstract

Apple announced their 2 year transition plan to internally-designed Apple
Silicon processors, ending the use of Intel x86-64 processors, at the
World Wide Developers Conference 2020 [@apple-announcement]. This report will
explore the transition's motives and results through investigating
the history and characteristics of other contemporary processor families,
comparing them to Apple's M1 series. Information was sourced through academic
reports, press releases, news articles, and the processor designer's
documentation.

# Reduced Instruction Set Computers & Complex Instruction Set Computers

All of the following processor families belong to two distinct computer architectures,
reduced instruction set computers (RISC), and complex instruction set computers
(CISC). These design philosophies affect the families architectures and
operation greatly; therefore, the philosophies principles and differences must
be explored to analyse the families details, differences, and practices.

As defined by John Mashey [-@risc-userpages], a contributor to the MIPS RISC
architecture [@john-mashey], most RISC architectures have: a load then store
architecture - 'no operations that combine load/store with arithmetic i.e., like
add from memory, or add to memory', no more than 1 operand that accesses a
memory address per instruction, standard fixed instruction sizes, and a small
amount of address modes. Crucially, the number of instructions does not determine
if a processor is RISC [@what-risc]

**RISC is not inherently lower power, or a mobile ISA
