- AMD
- PowerPC
- Intel
- ARM

ARM

- Lower frequencies - Wide execution path - wide decoders
  - Large ALUs
  - Large cache
  - Integrated ram, no need for longer buses -> save engergy
  - Closer RAM
  - More bandwidth
- Leading edge TSMC processes
  - Higher density
  - More energy efficiency
- E-cores
  - Different design from intel processors at time
  - Derived from phone designs
- Wider pieplines
